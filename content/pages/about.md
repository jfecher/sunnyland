SunnyLand applies protein chemistry, analysis and engineering to biology and medicine.  One program is “Hybrid Modality Engineering of Proteins”—a platform to introduce non-canonical chemical moieties and/or scaffolds into peptides and proteins to confer novel functions otherwise unavailable.  The second is to devise chemo-enzymatic methodologies to characterize protein modifications, such as crosslinking, isoaspartic acid formation (asparagine deamidation) and S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet or SAM)-dependent methylations.  In collaboration with biologists and clinicians alike, we also investigate their biological effects, and moreover, as critical attributes in protein pharmaceuticals.  A third program area is the mechanistic studies of and inhibitor design for enzymes with intriguing mechanisms and biomedical significance.
